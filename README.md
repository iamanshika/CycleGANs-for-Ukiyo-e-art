# CycleGANs-for-Ukiyo-e-art

The paper review of CycleGANs where we use CycleGANs for generating Ukiyo-e art.
Image-to-image translation involves generating a new synthetic version of a given image with a specific modification. The CycleGAN is a technique that involves the automatic training of image-to-image translation models. The models are trained in an unsupervised manner using a collection of images from the source and target domain that do not need to be related in any way. The core idea was to build and understand a CycleGAN to generate Ukiyo-e art.

The repository has 3 files:
- code.py
- prep_data.py
- CycleGANs.ipynb This file is the whole composed code including the data preparation and model definitions along with code explanation and paper review.
